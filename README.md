## AlmaBetter EDA Capstone Project 1 Airbnb

This project is a part of the [AlmaBetter Premium Program](https://www.almabetter.com/) , Banglore/Bengaluru ,Karnataka , India




The data we are going to analyse is the data of Airbnb NYC (2019). Our main objectives of analysis will be above four statements which can be briefed as learnings from hosts, areas, price, reviews, locations etc. but not limited to.we will also try to explore some more insights.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]
#### About the dataset:
This dataset has around 49,000 observations in it with 16 columns and it is a mix between categorical and numeric values.

Airbnb is an online marketplace connecting travelers with local hosts. On one side, the platform enables people to list their available space and earn extra income in the form of rent. On the other, Airbnb enables travelers to book unique homestays from local hosts, saving them money and giving them a chance to interact with locals. Catering to the on-demand travel industry, Airbnb is present in over 190 countries across the world.

#### Approach used:
the approach we have used in this project is can be defined in the given format-

1. Loading our data : In this section we simply loaded our data in google colab to further EDA.
2. Data Cleaning and  Processing :  In this section we have removed unnecessary features and then we have cleaned out data by filling null values based on certain reasonable assumptions.
3. Analysis and visualization : This section is divided into three parts.
3.1 : EDA on hosts, neighborhood, neighborhood groups and room types.
3.2 : EDA on price distributions
3.3 : EDA on availability, reviews and correlation matrix



#### Future scope of work:
Working out on Top neighbourhoods and group and compare their positions based on different indicators
Considering the amount of indicators in the data, if we dig deep enough, various micro trends can be unearthed, which we were not able to extensively cover during this short duration.
This data can also help to understand varioues properties and their demands.
The review column can be helpful to get insights from different neighbourhoods.

# Final Summary

This Airbnb-NYC(2019) dataset is very informative dataset having 48895 rows and 16 columns. we have found that any host can have many id's and host_id's based on their properties(2.2). we have found hosts that take good advantage of the Airbnb platform and provide the most listings; we found that our top host has 327 listings.Then we have seen that Manhattan has highest number of listings followed by Brooklyn and so on. After that, we proceeded with analyzing neighbourhood groups ,neighborhoods and found that in top 10 neighbourhoods only Manhattan and Brooklyn groups take part . Then we moved to analyze price and observed that Price is  more distributed across the dataset in a specified range (20,300). also there are some outliers.Another very interesting insights we found by analyzing revenue made by top hosts(top revenue makers) that top1000 hosts occupy approx 25% of all revenue and top 10000 occupy approx 61% of all revenue . In final section we observed that we have noticed that the minimum avg. availability is in Brooklyn followed by Manhattan and the maximum availability is in Staten. then we have found top 10 busiest hosts across NYC and noticed that Micheal is the busiest host followed by David and Sonder(NYC). This order is the as we had seen in section 2.1 for most listings. This can be due to high number of reviews in the neighbourhood. Overall, we discovered a very good number of interesting relationships between features and explained each step of the process. This analysis can help leaders in high level business decisions, control over the platform, marketing initiatives, implementation of new features and much more.
